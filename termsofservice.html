                <h3>DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION</h3>
                <p>The purpose of this Section is to provide a streamlined method for resolution of disputes between us if they arise. PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.</p>
                <p>Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by contacting our customer support at lgtproductions@getarmbarn.com. In the unlikely event that we cannot resolve a concern to your satisfaction (or if we cannot resolve a concern we have with you after attempting to do so informally), then you and we agree to be bound by the following procedure to resolve any and all disputes between us. This provision applies to all consumers to the fullest extent allowable by law. By accepting these terms, you and we expressly waive the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This agreement is intended to be interpreted broadly. This Section covers any and all disputes between us (“Disputes”), including without limitation:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;</li>
                    <li>claims that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);</li>
                    <li>claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and</li>
                    <li>claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>References to "we," "you," and "us" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or Software under this or prior Agreements between us. This arbitration provision evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms of Service.</p>
                <p>Binding Arbitration. If you and we are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, either you or we may elect to have the Dispute finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY THIS PROVISION, YOU AND we ARE FOREGOING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (AAA Consumer Rules), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, or if you send LGT Productions a notice indicating that you are unable to pay the fees required to initiate arbitration, then we will promptly pay all arbitration fees and expenses. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing and shall provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. You and we may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator, only.</p>
                <p><i>Restrictions.</i> You and we agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between LGT Productions and you, individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons. YOU AND LGT PRODUCTIONS AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.</p>
                <p><i>Location.</i> If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place at any reasonable location convenient for you. For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the County of Pittsburgh, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, United States of America, and you and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>
                <p><i>Limitation on Arbitrator’s Authority.</i> The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.</p>
                <p><i>Changes to This Provision.</i> Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if we make any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision.</p>
                <h3>ENTIRE AGREEMENT</h3>
                <p>The Terms of Service (including the ArmBarn Privacy Policy and other Supplemental Terms incorporated by reference into this document) constitute the entire agreement between you and we relating to your rights and obligations in the use of we Services.
